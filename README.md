# Weekly Challenge:

# Part 1
1. Make a new repository titled “CHEME 5500 WC 4”.
2. Write a python script called “hello.py” that simply prints “Hello World” to the terminal, and add
that to the master branch.
3. Make a new “gh-pages” branch.
4. Empty the gh-pages branch (make sure “hello.py” is still in your master branch!).
5. Add “index.html” and “.nojekyll” to your “gh-pages” branch. Note, “.nojekyll” is empty; however,
you can put whatever HTML you want in “index.html”.
6. Push this branch to origin (command line: git push origin gh-pages)
7. Checkout your new website! URL: username.github.io/CHEME 5500 WC 4 (where username is
YOUR username).

# Part 2
1. Return to the master branch of “CHEME 5500 WC 4”.
2. Write a python script called “mundaneMath.py” that adds together all the even numbers between 1
and 100, and prints to the terminal. Add that to the master branch.
3. Change your README.md to be interesting and descriptive of your project.
4. Go to settings, and change your GitHub Pages source to the Master branch.
5. Go to settings, and select a Jekyll theme.
6. Checkout your new website! URL: username.github.io/CHEME 5500 WC 4 (where username is
