# Weekly Challenge:

# Part 1
1. Make a new repository titled “CHEME 5500 WC 4”.
2. Write a python script called “hello.py” that simply prints “Hello World” to the terminal, and add
that to the master branch.
3. Make a new “gh-pages” branch.
4. Empty the gh-pages branch (make sure “hello.py” is still in your master branch!).
5. Add “index.html” and “.nojekyll” to your “gh-pages” branch. Note, “.nojekyll” is empty; however,
you can put whatever HTML you want in “index.html”.
6. Push this branch to origin (command line: git push origin gh-pages)
7. Checkout your new website! URL: username.github.io/CHEME 5500 WC 4 (where username is
YOUR username).

# Part 2
1. Return to the master branch of “CHEME 5500 WC 4”.
2. Write a python script called “mundaneMath.py” that adds together all the even numbers between 1
and 100, and prints to the terminal. Add that to the master branch.
3. Change your README.md to be interesting and descriptive of your project.
4. Go to settings, and change your GitHub Pages source to the Master branch.
5. Go to settings, and select a Jekyll theme.
6. Checkout your new website! URL: username.github.io/CHEME 5500 WC 4 (where username is
YOUR username).



Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kspkritika/CHEME_5500_WC_4/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kspkritika/CHEME_5500_WC_4/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
